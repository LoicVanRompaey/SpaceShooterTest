About : <br>
A first attempt to work with the Phaser framework, and one that taught me a lot. I'm particularly proud of making the ChaserShip chase the player when in a specific distance and the moving background.

TODO :

-add Leaderboard
-add extra lives
-add powerups
-edit spawnrate based on score
